# Growing Your Pet

That cute little egg is the first form of your unique little pal.
Growing your Cool Pet is easy and, dare we say, pretty exciting. So much of your Cool Pet's final form is determined by YOUR choices! Do you want to grow a Water Pet? Or are you raising a Fire Pet? They're both within your reach, but you'll need to pick the right items to make it happen. Or, maybe you want to give your Cool Pet everything you earn or buy, and be surprised by how it turns out. It's all up to you.

## Using items on Cool Pets

To properly grow your Cool Pet, you'll need to give it items to play with or consume. These items can be acquired by buying chests from the Cool Shop or purchasing items from the marketplace.

Once you have items, it's simple to give them to your Cool Pet:
Visit https://www.coolcatsnft.com/.
Connect your wallet to the website.
Click the Meowpad button at the top right of the website.
Go to the Inventory section of the Meowpad.
Make sure you're on the Pet Supplies filter on the left hand side (this should be the default).
Select an item you wish to use on a Cool Pet, then click "Use".
Select the Cool Pet you wish to use an item on and click "Confirm".
Success! You have given an item to your Cool Pet.

## Cool Pet stages

It takes time to grow a Cool Pet. Their evolution goes through many forms, from egg to hatching to hatched to final form. Advancing your Cool Pet all the way to its final form takes a certain number of interactions. 
Transitioning from one Cool Pet stage to another is a simple process of giving your pet items. Each stage has a required number of interactions before your Cool Pet transitions to the next stage. 
| Pet Stage | Number of Interactions |
| --- | --- |
| Egg > Hatching (Stage 2) | 10 |
| Egg > Hatching (Stage 2) | 10 |
| Hatching > Hatched (Stage 3) | 15 |
| Hatching > Hatched (Stage 3) | 15 |
| Hatched > Final Form (Stage 4) | 25 |
| Hatched > Final Form (Stage 4) | 25 |
These values may change as we balance the system.
Once your pet reaches its final form, it will no longer accept pet items. A Cool Pet that is sold with any item interactions will carry those interactions with them, even when sold. 

## How many items can I give my Cool Pet each day?

Cool Pets are little...and, like most growing creatures, they're still learning about how much of something is good for them and how much is too much. Strange things may happen if Cool Pets are given too many items, so for your safety and theirs, Cool Pets can only be given 5 items a day.
