Public mint includes any overflow from the Allow List, as well as approximately 1,500 tokens.

## How do I claim a Cool Pet if I'm a Cool Cat holder?


All Cool Cats can claim one Cool Pet. The Cool Pet will have the same number as the Cool Cat. If you're acquiring a Cool Cat in order to claim a Cool Pet, we urge you to use the Pet Checker to ensure the corresponding Cool Pet hasn't already been claimed. 

## How does the Allow List work for Cool Pets?


The Allow List for Cool Pets is simply a minting pass that grants the holder the ability to mint one Cool Pet. Allow List tickets are not NFT tokens. 

Our collaboration partners supply us with a list of addresses and that list is checked against at the time of minting. We see this approach to Allow Listing as an opportunity to strengthen the NFT community as a whole, which in turn strengthens our own community. For Cool Pets, we collaborated with a plethora of awesome NFT projects, including:

​Cyber Kongz​

​Robotos​

​Deadfellaz​

​Doodles​

​Vinnie Letters​

​World of Women​

​Creatures​

Our community was also very clear about its interest in a public mint. While we won't detail them here, we've put measures in place to deter a gas war on any Cool Cats-related public mints.

## What are the Cool Pets minting limits?

| Minting Type | Allowed Mints | Prevents Consecutive/Multiple Mints? |

Allow List spots can claim 1 Cool Pet during the mint, but simultaneously minting on the Allow List and minting from the public mint is possible, giving non-Cool Cat holders a chance to mint two Cool Pets.
