# What is a Cool Pet?

Meet the cool, cute companions to Cool Cats ( and check out their sweet abilities).
​
The Cool Cats ecosystem includes Cool Pets, a collection of programmatically, randomly generated NFTs that you interact with to help them grow into entirely unique creatures. There are 19,999 Cool Pets--9,999 for Cool Cats holders and 10,000 for public mint.

Similar to the way in which Cool Cats are layered with a variety of attributes (hats, faces, shirts, etc.) that determine their entirely unique appearance, Cool Pets also have a unique layering system. Using the Cool Shop and marketplace, you can use $MILK to purchase items for your Cool Pet that will influence their evolution. Once your Cool Pet has reached its final form, all of its components will be assembled and layered to bring your Cool Pet to life. These dynamic layering mechanics also allow for future interactivity with the NFT.
There are over 17 million total unique combinations of Pets, with more than 4 million combinations possible in each element! The cool and cute combinations are nearly endless.
