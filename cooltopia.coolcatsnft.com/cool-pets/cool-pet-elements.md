# Cool Pet Elements

Water, Grass, Wind, or Fire--which element sounds right for your Cool Pet?
Each item you can feed your Cool Pet has its own mood. The items you feed your Cool Pet will affect its affinity for each of the elements, which will help to determine your Cool Pet's final-form element
Not all items are made equal! Some items will have a stronger effect than others on your Cool Pets' elemental affinities. Some items may affect your Cool Pet's affinity to a single element, while others will affect multiple elements.
When you perform the final interaction required to hatch your Cool Pet, its strongest elemental affinity will determine its final element. If your Cool Pet has an equal affinity to multiple elements, one will be assigned based on your Cool Pet's most recent interactions.
We don't share the details on how each item affects the elemental affinities of a Cool Pet, but we know many Cool Pet holders try to plan out the best route to get the element they want, so we won't stop you from trying to figure it out. :)

## What elements are possible?

Four elements are available right now, but in the future we may introduce more elements using our fracture system, in order to  combat balancing issues, introduce new game mechanics, and keep everything fun. Currently, the known Cool Pet elements/types are:
Fire
Water
Grass
Air
The benefits of these elements will come into play in future utility/gamification.
