# Canceling Listings

Didn't mean to list something in the marketplace? Don't panic!
â€‹
If you have listed an item for sale and then changed your mind about selling it, you can easily cancel the listing:
Visit https://www.coolcatsnft.com.
Connect your wallet to the website.
Click the Meowpad button.
Click the Market tab to open the marketplace.
Click the My Listings button at the bottom left.
Select a listing and click Cancel.
After canceling a listing, your item will reappear in your inventory and you can use it on your Cool Pet if you wish.
