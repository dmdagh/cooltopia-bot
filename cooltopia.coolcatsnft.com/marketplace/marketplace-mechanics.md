# Marketplace Mechanics

For those curious about the marketplace's inner workings...

## Where do my items go?

When you list an item on the marketplace, it gets transferred to the marketplace wallet. From there, it can either be returned to your wallet if you cancel the listing, or it can be transferred to the wallet of whoever buys it.

## Marketplace vs. OpenSea

All Cooltopia items exist as ERC1155 tokens in your wallet unless you have listed them for sale in the marketplace. This means that you can freely sell them on OpenSea. Our system will detect the sale and update your inventory accordingly.
