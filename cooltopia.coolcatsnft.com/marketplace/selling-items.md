# Selling Items


Found yourself with some items that aren't quite right for your Cool Pet? Bring them to the marketplace!

## How do I sell items?


To sell items in the marketplace:

Visit https://www.coolcatsnft.com/.

Connect your wallet to the website.

Open up the Meowpad at the top right of the screen.

Click the inventory tab and select an item.

Click Sell to sell that item.

Select how much you wish to sell the item for and click ok.

Wait for the item to sell--good luck!

## How much do I earn for selling items?


You set the price! You only make $MILK when the item has been purchased by another user in the system.

A transaction fee of 10% is added to all marketplace sales, to cover system gas fees.

## How do I collect my $MILK?


The $MILK from items you sell in the marketplaces goes directly to you--you don't need to do anything to collect it.
