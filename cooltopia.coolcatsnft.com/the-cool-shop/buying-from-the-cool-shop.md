# Buying from The Cool Shop


Come on in for all your Cooltopia needs!

## What is the Cool Shop?


The Cool Shop is an in-game market where you can purchase supplies, using $MILK. You'll need all sorts of items in order to progress through Cooltopia, but specifically for Cool Pets, you'll need Pet Supplies. More items and supplies will be available in the Cool Shop as Cooltopia grows. Right now, the main thing you'll purchase from the Cool Shop are chests that contain items for your Cool Pet.




## Cool Shop Chests


What do chests contain? You won't know until you open one! When you buy and open a chest, the randomly assembled items inside will be delivered straight to your inventory. For example, Pet Supplies chests include all sorts of items that will grow your Pet, such as a Pet Frog or a Fiery Cake! Items are made up of elements--think of a red-hot chili pepper being made up of 4 fire elements. Items do not determine the individual assets of a Cool Pet, e.g., its arms and head. Item rarity is determined by the random distribution created by the Pet Supply chests.
| Cool Shop Item | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Pet Supplies | 4,500 $MILK |
| Pet Supplies | 4,500 $MILK |

Prices of chests may change as we balance the system.

$MILK spent in the Cool Shop is burned.
