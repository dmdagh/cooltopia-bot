# Re-rolling Quests


Not happy with what was originally on offer? Not to worry--there's plenty to do.

It's possible the first set of quests you roll doesn't strike your fancy. No problem: you can always re-roll your quests, as long as you have enough $MILK:
| Action | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Quest reroll | 27 $MILK |
| Quest reroll | 27 $MILK |

Click the Meowpad button at the top right of the website.

Click the Quests tab.

Click the Re-roll Quests button. As long as you have the required $MILK, you'll be delivered five new quests.

As long as you have $MILK, you can continue to re-roll quests until you find one you like. A word of warning, though: we suggest you complete at least some quests, or you run the risk of running out of $MILK! You may think a quest doesn't sound that exciting, but you'd be amazed by what kind of challenges your Cool Pet is up!

(If you do run out of $MILK, you can always earn more by doing common quests, and just by owning a Cool Pet or Cool Cat.)

All $MILK spent on re-rolling quests is burned.
