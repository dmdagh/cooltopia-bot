# The Adventurers' Guild

Like Cool Pets day care...except you'll earn $MILK while they do all the work.
Too busy for questing? Cool Cat holders can always send their Cool Pets off to The Adventurers' Guild, where they complete quests on their own. While there, your pet will passively earn $MILK that you can then claim and spend as you wish! The Adventurers' Guild will earn a lower $MILK amount than actively questing, and you won't earn any item rewards, but it is a way to  keep your Cool Pets out of trouble and earn $MILK no matter what's happening outside of Cooltopia.
You won't be able to quest with your Cool Pet while they're in The Adventurers' Guild, but you can interact with them using items. You can also sell your Cool Pet while it's in the Guild; if you do, the new owner will be able to claim all of the $MILK earned since the last claim time, so claim before you sell!
You can stake your Cool Pet at any time--even when it's in egg form--so your Cool Pet can earn $MILK passively from the moment you collect it.
Eventually, The Adventurers' Guild will be a place where you can effectively borrow another holder's Cool Pet. More details will be revealed on this functionality over time.
