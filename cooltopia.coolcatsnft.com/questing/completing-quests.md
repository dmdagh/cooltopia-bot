# Completing Quests


Need a little loot? TIme to get to work!

Your Cool Pets love completing quests--just send them off on an adventure and they'll come back with rewards. When choosing quests, we suggest sending the best Cool Pet for the job...even if it's not the best quest in your log. If you match your Cool Pet's element to the quest element, great things can happen!

## How to complete a quest


To complete a quest:

Visit https://www.coolcatsnft.com.

Click Connect to connect to the website.

Click the Meowpad at the top right of the website.

Click the Quests tab.

After all of your quests are visible, select a quest. You will see the quest's story text, bonus, and rewards in more detail on the right-hand side.

After selecting a quest, you can click the big plus (+) button to select which Cool Pet you wish to send on the quest.

Now click Complete Quest. Your Cool Pet will venture off and return almost instantly with the outcome of the quest. You may have a minor or a major success, depending on how lucky your Pet is!

After completing a quest, you will be given 5 new quests to choose from. We hope you get some good ones!

Remember, Cooltopia is still growing. Over time, your Cool Pets will discover new quests, with different rewards, different quest types, and plenty of new lore and adventures.
