# Quest Bonuses

Some things to consider when choosing your quests.
​

## Can I earn bonuses based on which Cool Pet I use to complete a quest?


## Element Bonus

You can complete a quest with any Cool Pet...but If you choose to complete a quest with a Cool Pet that has the same element affinity as that quest, you'll earn additional rewards! A common quest with a fire elemental bonus might even pay more than an epic quest without a bonus, for example. All the more reason to start feeding your Cool Pet some items (or to consider growing a Cool Pet for each element).

## Pet Stage Bonus

While you can quest with your Cool Pet when it's in egg form, it won't have arms yet, so it won't be able to carry any item rewards it receives from the quest. But as you progress your Cool Pet, it is able to receive bonuses and eventually even any items that a quest might drop. 
You never know what item you'll get from a quest, so getting your Cool Pet to its final form increases your chances of finding and being able to use the cool stuff.
