# Quests


Cool Pets can go on quests to help Sapphire Town and Cooltopia. Excitement awaits!

## What are quests?


From little tasks to epic adventures, quests are ways your Cool Pets can help Sapphire Town...and help you earn some $MILK or items. Each Cool Pet can complete up to 10 quests per day.

## What types of quests are available?


Quests are divided into rarities ranging from Common to Legendary. You can determine how epic a quest is by checking the size of the stars and the color of the quest in its listing.

You will receive 5 different quests when you first visit the Quest tab in the Meowpad. These will have random rarities and randomized rewards, so hope for the best from the quests you choose!

## Quest Rarities


Quests can be common, uncommon, rare, epic, or legendary. Every time your Cool Pet is offered quests, at least two are guaranteed to be common. This is done to ensure that all users are able to complete something from their roll.

The remaining three quests will have the following rarity distributions:
| Rarity | Roll Probability |
| --- | --- |
| Common | 24% |
| Common | 24% |
| Uncommon | 40% |
| Uncommon | 40% |
| Rare | 30% |
| Rare | 30% |
| Epic | 4% |
| Epic | 4% |
| Legendary | 2% |
| Legendary | 2% |

These values may change as we balance the system.

## How much can I earn from quests?


Quests can pay rewards in the form of $MILK and/or items, although the latter does not apply to every quest. Quests can also carry bonus payouts in accordance with your Cool Pet's evolutionary stage. Some quests also give a bonus in accordance with the element of your Cool Pet and the elemental bonus of the Quest. Bonuses can really add up and it might not always make sense to pick the highest tier of Quest. Keep an eye out for bonuses to stack for higher rewards.

Depending on which quests you complete, you'll earn a range of rewards:
| Quest Rarity | Min Milk | Max Milk | Item |

Did your Cool Pet perform amazing feats of greatness during a quest? You could earn increased rewards depending on how successful your Cool Pet was during a quest. A major or minor success will be displayed upon quest completion and will be announced in the quest success text.

## Item Rewards


Not every quest will reward you with items, and for those that do, your Cool Pet must be in its final form in order to receive them. (You can't expect an egg to carry a quest item, right?)
