# Earning $MILK


Cats love milk...and Cool Cats love $MILK!

## What is $MILK?


$MILK is a token that enhances interactivity within the Cool Cats gamified ecosystem, and ultimately provides more utility to users within Cooltopia. What does that mean, exactly? It means by giving users ways to earn and spend $MILK, we're able to give them more things to do! Put another way, $MILK reinforces our gamified economy, and a healthy economy is what will allow us to grow and add more and more cool stuff to Cooltopia.

$MILK exists as an ERC20 token on Ethereum and Polygon; it's claimable/earnable within the world of Cool Cats. Soon, we'll supply a Polygon to Ethereum bridge, utilizing the Polygon PoS bridge. This will allow $MILK holders to bridge between the Polygon and Ethereum networks. 

## What can I do with $MILK?


$MILK is the key to all sorts of functionality and fun in the Cool Cats ecosystem, from buying Battle or Housing chests to going on quests. $MILK is also how you'll enhance and evolve your Cool Pets...and that's just the beginning. Over time, we'll add more and more features and functions that you'll need $MILK to fully enjoy.

## How do I earn $MILK?


There are a number of ways right now to earn $MILK. If you're a Cool Cat holder, you're already earning it! Your Cool Cat is earning $MILK just by being cool (the $MILK claiming clock begins as soon as the contract is deployed), and that $MILK will accumulate over time. Though your Cool Cat is earning $MILK every day, you can claim your $MILK anytime you wish--once a day, once a week, once a month, etc. Here's how:

Visit https://www.coolcatsnft.com/.

Connect your wallet (e.g. Metamask).

Click 'Claim Milk' to claim the $MILK for all of the Cool Cats you currently hold. (If you haven't connected to our gaming system yet, you'll be prompted to connect. It runs on Polygon, but don't worry, we cover the gas costs for connecting.)

Another way to earn $MILK is to send your Cool Pet on quests. The amount earned depends on the Cool Pet's evolutionary stage and its element, e.g, whether it earns an element bonus on that specific quest. Cool Cat holders can also send final form Cool Pets on passive quests via The Adventurers' Guild.

## How much $MILK does my Cool Cat earn?


Cool Cats earn a base rate of 1,000 $MILK each day, with incremental $MILK bonuses based on their tiers (an additional 50 $MILK per day per tier--see the table below for exactly how much $MILK each tier earns). As we add additional features to Cooltopia, other tier-related benefits will be distributed throughout the ecosystem, so keep an eye out for more $MILK-earning opportunities in the coming months.

These values may change as we balance the system.

## How are these values decided?


A well-balanced system is our ultimate goal: we've worked to avoid front-loading the tier benefits while also incorporating/rewarding the differences in Cool Cat tiers. We're aiming to spread the benefits of owning higher-tier Cool Cats throughout the whole gaming system. That said, Cooltopia is specced as an enormous game system, so more tier-specific values and earning opportunities will continue to roll out over time.

## Can I earn $MILK any other ways?


You can! Questing and evolving your Cool Pet to its final form are both ways to earn more $MILK. For example, a Cool Pet can earn a $MILK bonus if its final-form element matches a particular quest’s elemental bonus (e.g., and Air Pet completes a quest with an Air bonus). Cool Cat holders can also earn passive $MILK by staking final-form Cool Pets in The Adventurers' Guild (though this will earn them less than if they'd manually completed the quest themselves, and does not earn items).
