# What are Cool Cats?

The coolest cats on the blockchain
Cool Cats are a collection of programmatically, randomly generated NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The first generation consists of 9,999 randomly assembled cats from over 300,000 total combinations of outfits, faces, and colors. Each Cool Cat is comprised of a unique body, hat, face, and outfit: all Cats are cool, but everyone has their favourite - what's yours?

## How do I get a Cool Cat?

The minting has finished, so the only place to purchase a Cool Cat is on OpenSea. (If you're purchasing a Cool Cat in order to claim a free Cool Pet, we suggest you use our handy Pet Checker to make sure that Cool Cat's Pet hasn't already been minted.)

## What are Cool Cat tiers?

Cool Cats have been categorized into eight tiers. Rarity is partially determined by tiers, but there are also rarities for specific traits and combinations of traits (for example, a Cool Cat in a full frog costume).

## What can I do with my Cool Cat?

Cool Cats are a key way (but not the only way) to earn $MILK, the token that drives Cooltopia's economy. If you're a Cool Cat holder, you'll automatically earn $MILK that you can claim daily and use for activities across Cooltopia, in cities like Sapphire Town, home to the Blue Cats.
