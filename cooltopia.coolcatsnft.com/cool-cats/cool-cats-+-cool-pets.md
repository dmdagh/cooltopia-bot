# Cool Cats + Cool Pets

Cool Cats holders, say hello to your little friends.

## If I have a Cool Cat, can I get a Cool Pet?

All Cool Cats can claim one Cool Pet. The Cool Pet will have the same token ID as the Cool Cat. 
If you're acquiring a Cool Cat in order to claim a Cool Pet, we urge you to use the Pet Checker to ensure the corresponding Cool Pet hasn't already been claimed.

## How do I claim my Cool Pet?

Claiming a Cool Pet is super simple, and there is no time limit on when a Cool Cat can be used to claim its Cool Pet. To claim your Cool Pet:
Visit https://www.coolcatsnft.com/.
Connect your wallet to the website.
Click the Meowpad button at the top right.
Go to the Cats screen.
Click the Claim Eggs button and select the Cool Cats you wish to claim against.
Confirm you wish to claim the Cool Pet and they will be added to your account!
If you hold multiple Cool Cats and wish to claim all of their Cool Pets at once, you can claim up to 50 pets in a single transaction. This is enforced by the contract, to help prevent gassing out.
It may take a few minutes for your Pet(s) to appear. We recommend refreshing or double-checking that the transaction has gone through on OpenSea if you don't see anything right away.
