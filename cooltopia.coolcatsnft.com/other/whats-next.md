# What's Next?

There's much to come in the world of Cooltopia!
Working on Cool Cats and Cool Pets is a lot of work, but we are setting a solid foundation for even more utility, gamification and stories to be told in the future! Along with everything currently listed within this site we are also working through the following ideas for the future.
Working on Cool Cats and Cool Pets is a lot of work, but we're setting a solid foundation for even more utility, gamification, and stories to be told in the future! Along with everything currently listed here in the Cool Hub, we're working on the following ideas for the future:

## Questing & The Adventures' Guild Expansion

We see a huge amount of possibility with our questing system. What you see now in the base system is the tiny drop in the ocean compared to our idea for expansion. Much more to come here.

## Crafting

Our future systems will involve some level of crafting. As an example, imagine using the items you're currently using with your Cool Pet to craft newer items! More details at a later date.

## Housing

We are working through several possibilities for housing/villages, expanding the Cooltopia ecosystem even further. Stay tuned for more on this in the coming months.

## Battling

Who doesn't want to battle?! More to come here, too.

## Anything else?

While we have no shortage of ideas, our current focus is ensuring a solid, well-performing foundation before delving into further functionality. Our primary goal right now is to successfully introduce a level of gameplay that can drive all of our future systems.
