# Cool Cats - Cool Hub

The official resource for all things Cool Cats, Cool Pets, and the world of Cooltopia, updated regularly by the Cool Cats team. We like the Cats!

## What Is Cooltopia?

Cooltopia is the Cool Cats ecosystem, including all of the components within Cool Cats that talk to one another: the Cool Cats NFT collection, Cool Pets NFT collection, the gamified and tokenized economy driven by $MILK, the questing system, the Cool Shop and marketplace, etc. Over time, we’ll add to and grow Cooltopia, making the experience for our holders more and more fun, interesting, and rich.
Our aim is to create the most accessible gamified NFT experience; to be a place where having a Cool Cats NFT grants you evolving access to games, tokens, community events, collaborations, and more. We believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to expand the Cool Cats team, bringing on more game developers, artists, and designers by raising capital through offerings like Cool Pets.
An integral part of who we are as a brand is our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. Our most important asset is our community, which prides itself on being welcoming, friendly, funny, and respectful. We support other NFT projects, and we support one another. Cooltopia is and will continue to be designed to bring that experience to as many people as possible. Whether you’re a Cool Cat holder or not…you’re still a Cool Cat to us.
